This repository contains single header C/C++ single libraries I use in my games.
For more details on how to use each library, look at the documentation section 
of each library source, and/or at the corresponding library test.

For now, libraries are tested using Clang-cl under Windows 10 using Visual Studio 2019,
for 64 bit architectures. Support for other platforms will be added soon.
